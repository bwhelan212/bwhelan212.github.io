### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
    The focus of lab 7 part 2 was revolved around a game of BlackJack.
    I turned 21 over the pandemic and have never gamblemed or been to vegas
    since then, however I will be going to vegas the Friday after finals. It
    was interesting to see how all the different functions performed to make
    a succesful game of blackjack that actually worked. Maybe I will be able
    to use what I learned about blackjack to win some money to cover for
    these classes.

* Lab 11
   lab 11 part 2 was the final version of the hilo game that impelementing using OOP, random number generators, random numbers, for loops, if statements. It was interesting to see what we could change as we learned more about how to organize and code in C++. I tested this code out multiple times with my partner to see if it worked, and it was interesting to see it actually work as the user.

* Lab 12
   Lab 12 part 2 was focused on generating random numbers and creating images using the Magick++ API with OOP. I was able to create images using the different classes from Magick using if statements and for loops. We also used vectors store the pixels for the images which was used to create the image in the end.
