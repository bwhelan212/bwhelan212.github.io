### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
The focus of lab 7 part 2 was revolved around a game of BlackJack.
I turned 21 over quarantine and have never gamblemed or been to vegas
since then, however I will be going to vegas the Friday after finals. It
was interesting to see how all the different functions performed to make
a succesful game of blackjack that actually worked. I liked this lab because I will be able to use what I learned about blackjack to (hopefully) win some moeny/games.

* Lab 11
Lab 11 part 2 was the final version of the hilo game that we impelemented using OOP, random number generators, random numbers, for loops, if statements. I liked that we could change the code as we learned more about how to organize our code in C++. I tested this code out multiple times with my boyfriend to see if it worked/for fun, and it was interesting to see how it actually works with a user.

* Lab 12
Lab 12 part 2 was focused on generating random numbers and creating images using the Magick++ API with OOP. I was able to learn how to create images using the different classes from Magick using if statements and for loops. We also used vectors store the pixels for the images which was used to create the image in the end. I liked this lab because the expected output was colorful and fun.
